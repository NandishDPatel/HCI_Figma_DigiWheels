# DigiWheels (Human-Computer Interaction Project)
DigiWheels mobile app creation using the Figma Website
[https://www.figma.com/file/F7DCzEMGs17EA10IySuPza/HCI-Project?node-id=0%3A1]

### Motivation:
As of now, the government has already provided the website for booking a slot for a
driving test, to apply for a renewal of driver's license, to pay the e-challan, to download
and view the registered certificate, etc. but the users are not familiar with the design of
the websites, so users have to apply through various agents or sometimes they have to
go to the RTO office for registration. So to make the world digitized we have created a
‘DigiWheels’ website provides a user-friendly, simple and can do all of the mentioned
tasks from one website.

### Goal of the Project:
The goal of this website/application is to provide users with effortless access to transport
information along with the application for license and other transport-related documents. A user
should be able to
* apply for a new learner/permanent license
* Renew his/her driving license
* Save and view his/her driving license in digital form
* View details of vehicles registered to his/her name
* View, dispute and pay traffic violation fines with his/her payment method of choice i.e.
credit cards, UPI, wallets, net banking, etc.
* Apply for a special vehicle permit
* See if he/she is compliant with various traffic regulations such as a compulsory FastTag,
valid PUC certificate and take necessary actions in case he is not
